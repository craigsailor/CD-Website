					<p>
						<u>Organization:</u>
						<br> In the wake of the Haiti earthquake in 2010, the American Red Cross raised 500 million dollars to help Haitians. Seven years later, it is difficult to know what happened to that money.
						<br>
						<br> For the Red Cross to be managed as a cryptographic democracy, its structure has to be phrased as in a structured computer format. Its rules and allowed processes needs to be well defined. Then it can be assured that the donations are handled by the organization internal rules. Auditing is equivalent in such case to tracing a Bitcoin transactions, mitigating investigation of suchs issues.
						<br>
						<br>
						<u>International effort:</u>
						<br> The Paris agreement establish a “Technology framework” (Article 10) for communication of parties, which shall be “maintained by the secretariat” as a “public registry” (Article 7.12).
						<br>
						<br> This framework can be implemented as a cryptographic democracy in almost a complete organic way. The parties can create and ID for themselves, and it can be recognized by other in the genesis block. The rest of the process is developed democratically with voting of the parties. Data is shared among everyone, and a complete accurate record is kept transparently.
						<br>
						<br>
						<u>Distributed state:</u>
						<br> The structure of a state as a large body bounded by geographical borders has existed unchanged for thousands of years. But is it bound to remain that way forever? 
						<br>
						<br>
						Internet communities have discovered that cyber-groups can be as strong social-structures as non-virtual ones. The invention of blockchains demonstrated that cryptography and consensus algorithms are developed enough to replace traditional institutes such as lawyers, notaries and audits.
						<br>
						<br>
						Distributed state: a state which is not defined by large bounded geographical areas. It may consist of a collection of assorted holdings, or alternatively hold no possessions at all. 
						<br>
						<br>
						In distributed states, one apartment in a building may belong to one state, while the opposite apartment to another state. One neighbour is a citizen of state A, the other a citizen of state B.
						<br>
						<br>
						Distributed states are the holy grail of Cryptographic Democracy. Alas, a long path lays ahead of us before and if such a state would be materialize. We are proposing a first step in the form of an infrastructure for such states.

					<h3>What we do, practically</h3>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
					<p>
						We create a tool to establish and manage organizations (or any other social structures) in a distributed decentralized manner. It consists of
						<ul>
							<li>structured format to describe organizations. </li>
							<li>set of tools to create and manage organizations. </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						The format describes an organization is a combination of script and cryptographic tools. It looks similar to a blockchain data structure (also known as, hashed linked trees). This unlike legal contracts which are commonly used today. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The organization is managed as a private blockchain (a method to make decisions in closed groups). This gives the organization a distributed identity (equivalent to legal identity of traditional organizations), simplifying participation for all members in the organization and making it very difficult for the organization to be corrupted by a small nefarious group.
					</p>
					<p>
						And slightly more technically:
					</p>
					<p>
						Establishing a Cryptographic Democracy has the following steps.
					</p>
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li>Creating a constitution. The constitution includes a list of members and rules of the organization. The result is a“.org” file, signed by the founders of the organization.</li>
							<li>Each organization action is done by a software, app or web app. It records and broadcast the action. Example for actions: adding/removing a member, changing positions within the organization, monetary or changing rules/laws decisions.</li>
							<li>An org file has a timestamp. The nature of a valid timestamp is described in the constitution (one out of X members, blockchain proof of existence, etc.).</li>
							<li>The timestamp verifies that this is the state of the organization at a given time. There are verification tools to verify that a .org file is valid. This is a proof that the organization did not violate the constitution.</li>
						</ol>
